## Project Overview

This repository contains various projects focused on implementing reinforcement learning techniques, data processing, and data collection methodologies. Each project addresses different aspects of reinforcement learning and data manipulation, utilizing frameworks like OpenAI Gym, Keras, and Pandas.

## Projects

### pipeline

#### apis
This section contains projects focused on interacting with APIs to retrieve and display data. 

Projects focused on interacting with APIs to retrieve and display data.<br>
API calls include retrieving data related to spaceships, planets, and rocket launches using the SWAPI and SpaceX APIs.<br>
Also includes tasks for fetching data, handling pagination, and formatting output.

#### databases

Covers creating and managing databases, tables, and performing data operations such as insertion, retrieval, and aggregation in MySQL and MongoDB.

#### pandas

Using pandas to create DataFrames from various sources, renaming columns, handling missing values, concatenating DataFrames, and visualizing data.

### reinforcement_learning

#### deep_q_learning

Creates a Deep Q-Learning agent to play Atari's Breakout using Keras. It covers fundamentals of Deep Q-learning, policy networks, and training a DQN agent.

#### policy_gradients

Implements policy gradient methods for training an agent in the CartPole environment, covering policy function computation and Monte-Carlo policy gradient calculations.

#### q_learning

Creates a reinforcement learning agent navigating the Frozen Lake environment using Q-learning. It includes environment setup, Q-table initialization, and agent training.

#### temporal_difference

Implements Monte Carlo methods, TD(λ), and SARSA(λ) for solving the FrozenLake environment, focusing on value estimation and updating methods.
